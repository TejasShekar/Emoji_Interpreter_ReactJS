What you can do is:

1. add , at the end of each sentence. Then split the sentences with "," as the breakpoint which will return a massive array of string.

2. Then again split/slice each string in the array with " " as the breakpoint which gives you an array of each string.

3. string[0] will be the emoji and the rest forms the meaning. So, you can create an object which pushed index[0] for the key and concat the rest of the string into one single string and push that to value of that key.

This will create a huge object that has a key:value pair of the emojis you want. 

You can then feed that to this react app.
